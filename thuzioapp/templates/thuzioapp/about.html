	<h5>This app is a proof of concept/MVP to learn the django framework. Future implementations for a production quality application must require the following...</h5>
	<hr/>
	<ul>
		<li>Change float values in models to decimal!</li>
		<li>Utilize forms / formfactory</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Dynamically generate form objects to pass into templates.</li>
				<li>Add validation on forms</li>
				<li>Original plan was to use forms for admincp but that was benched due to arithmetic functions required to populate most of the prices and costs</li>
				<li>One work around to use the forms within admincp would then be to customize the models init function to run the arithmetic during model instantiation, separate from the controller</li>
				<li>Could also implement forms within the thuzioapp</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Examine utilization of cache and user cases that could cause issues</li>
		<li>Explore further abstraction of database models to limit excessive fields (perhaps store internal marketing related info into a non-relational db)</li>
		<li>Add image processor to app for product images</li>
		<li>Store/read images from s3 bucket for product images</li>
		<li>Add redirect history</li>
		<li>Add account options (reset/forgot password, remember me, etc)</li>
		<li>Refactor front end JS (in particular the detail template (indexing elements is not scaleable)</li>
		<li>Implement Promo's</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Add promo boolean field onto product in db</li>
				<li>Add promo img src onto product in db = stored on s3</li>
				<li>Add query on index action</li>
				<li>Pass that product promo img into index template through request context and display the promo</li>
				<li>Add functionality into adminCP so staff can choose which product to promo</li>
				<li>Create image carousel to support multiple promo's</li>
				<li>Add validation to ensure set # of promo's in carousel</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Unit testing</li>
		<li>Responsive design for mobile web users</li>
		<li>Multibrowser compatibility testing</li>
		<li>Cronjob / rake task to clean up and/or track incomplete purchases and schedule reminder emails</li>
		<li>Refactor/optimize views</li>
		<li>Remove unnecesssary fields from db table</li>
		<li>Add categories to product table and implement search by categories</li>
		<li>Expire session cache</li>
		<li>Clear shopping cart cache on successful purchase</li>
	</ul>
